# Virus
This is a virus written in python, it deletes files into dirs, and it spreads itself, to make it hard to delete.<br>
WARNING : Please use it for educational purposes. DONT PUT THE VIRUS INSIDE ROOT or IMPORTANT DIRECTORIES.

### How does it work?
This simple virus deletes files in a specific directory, but what makes it dangerous is it walks through other directories and it deletes its files.
And to make it hard for the victim to delete it, it spreads it self into multiple files (it copies it self into multiple other files with a random-generated name)
### Goal :
My goal of making this virus is to see how it works, and how python can be used to manipulate the file system, and this is just a very basic version, now i'm currently working on other complex viruses using python (JUST FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES) and i'll upload them inside this directory. Feel free to use it and customize it.
